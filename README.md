## Scrum Assessment Activity
 > A simple team activity to assess maturity and performance of your Scrum implementation. The idea was taken from ["Nokia Test", a.k.a the "Scrumbutt" Test.](http://jeffsutherland.com/scrum/ScrumButtTest.pdf). Unlike the Scrumbutt test, this activity is stricly based on the [The Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html). You can use it as described here or as an extensive checklist.
 
 ### How does it work?
 
 - It is a team activity. It works just like a planning-poker session.

 - You need Fibonacci planning poker cards to estimate.

 - There are thirteen areas of assessment, each option scores a value in the Fibonnacci sequence.

 - After reading the slide, team members provide an estimation.

 - The Scrum Master moderates and facilitates the discussion. 

 > The objective is to assess the maturity and performance, not to perform root cause analysis.
   Aim to share points of view to 1) agree on your actual situation and 2) establish a baseline for future improvement

 - People might have different degrees of knowledge and understanding. Reaching an agreement may not be possible, and it is by no means the objective of the activity.

 - Take notes on the team's estimations and observations. Repeat the activity periodically with the same team. Inspect and adapt.
