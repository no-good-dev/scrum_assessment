## Scrum Assessment Activity
 > A simple team activity to assess maturity and performance of your Scrum implementation. The idea was taken from ["Nokia Test", a.k.a the "Scrumbutt" Test.](http://jeffsutherland.com/scrum/ScrumButtTest.pdf) Updated to the Scrum Guide 2020.
 
 - It is a team activity. It works just like a planning-poker session.

 - You need Fibonacci planning poker cards to estimate.

 - There are thirteen areas of assessment in the form of questions.

 - After reading the slide, team members provide an estimation.

 - The Scrum Master moderates and facilitates the discussion. 

 - The objective is to assess the maturity and performance, not to perform root cause analysis. Set up a separate discussion that.

 - People might have different degrees of knowledge and understanding. Reaching an agreement may not be possible, and it is by no means the objective of the activity.

 - Take notes on the team's estimations and observations. Repeat the activity periodically with the same team. Inspect and adapt.
